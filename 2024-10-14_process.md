# Timeline
Here, I listed aproximatly when my roomates where out of there room during the week. I marked in red the "dangerous hours" and in green the "safe ones" in grey it kinda depends on the day.

# FlatMap
I made a 3D map of the whole flat and did a few "simulations" on it.

The first one represents the paths that I will likely take during the day it includes going to the kitchen, the bathroom, the restroom and out of the flat :

Then I aded the paths my roomates will take and it gets real messy real quick. It shows that I have a hight chance of encountering them during the day:

The third render shows the most dangerous and likely places to be spotted. The redder it gets, the lesser the chnaces of being abble to see if my roomates are in the common space while getting out of my room. The bigger the circle the higher the chances of being found (linked to the number of doors and exits):

The last one is about the different sences I perceive from my room and where they likely come from:
