# Timeline
Here, I listed aproximatly when my roommates where out of there room during the week. I marked in red the "dangerous hours" and in green the "safe ones" in grey it kinda depends on the day.

Did the same during the week-end, there are no green hours because there was always someone in the flat.

During Red hours :
During the week around 7 to 8am one of my roommates wakes up so I checks if the door of the bathroom is open or lighten up from below, if not available I wait but usually it is when I get out of my room. Then I go fetch the food I’ll eat for breakfast and get back to my room. Once I’l done I put everything in place, and go to school.

During the evening I will use my senses to try and find a moment to go make lunch. I put wherever I’m gonna eat into the microwave and wait in my room. Once it’s ready I go get it and get back once again in my room. Usually the shower is available in the evening so I can use it more or less whenever I want.

During the weekend tis another story. I wake up quite randomly between 8 and 10 am. I hate when Roommate 1 brings his girlfriend cause they cook for hours and if I don’t get breakfast before 11am I’m cooked. They usually eat in his room but once they’re done they take ages to clean everything so the kitchen is truly available around 13 to 14 pm that’s when I can eat. But it depends on the weekend, once I waited till 5pm to have the kitchen, yes I was starving fr. Pretty much the same nonsense for the evening but she usually leaves on Sunday so I’m good during the last few hours of the weekend.

# FlatMap
I made a 3D map of the whole flat and did a few "simulations" on it.

The first one represents the paths that I will likely take during the day it includes going to the kitchen, the bathroom, the restroom and out of the flat :

Then I aded the paths my roommates will take and it gets real messy real quick. It shows that I have a hight chance of encountering them during the day:

The third render shows the most dangerous and likely places to be spotted. The redder it gets, the lesser the chnaces of being abble to see if my roommates are in the common space while getting out of my room. The bigger the circle the higher the chances of being found (linked to the number of doors and exits):

The last one is about the different sences I perceive from my room and where they likely come from:

# How2avoid
A simple list of things to do to avoid a dangerous encounter with my roommates like, trying to not look them in the eyes or wearing headphones to avoid any unnecessary conversations and if required, make those conversations short. Faking going to the toilet is a means to check if the kitchen is available.

# Chronological perception

Similarly to the timeline, I listed but more specificaly what I could perceive from my room and sometimes outside during a day of the week and one in the week-end.

During a typical day of the week:
